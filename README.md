# Breakout Game 🎮

Let's play a classic **Breakout Game**!  

This is a project I’m proud of — maybe not the most advanced, but I really enjoyed building it.  

## How to Use

1. Open your terminal and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/priyanshuchaudhary2425/breakoutgame.git
````

2. Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd breakoutgame
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

Have fun playing! 🕹️

```

If you want, I can also **add a “Controls” section and optional screenshot placeholder** to make it look more professional for GitHub. Do you want me to do that?
